### Visual

#### Key insights
- Revenue trend: identify growth/decline periods and seasonality (e.g., month/quarter spikes).
- Product mix: top-selling items drive most revenue; investigate long-tail products for bundling or pruning.
- Customers: a small set of buyers likely generate disproportionate revenue; consider tiered benefits for high-LTV segments.
- Regions/channels: performance varies; double down on high-ROI regions/channels and fix or exit underperformers.
- Pricing/discounts: heavy discount windows lift volume but can compress margins; test smaller, targeted promotions.

#### Business recommendations
- Pricing: run A/B tests on key SKUs (good/better/best tiers); avoid blanket discounts.
- Product strategy: bundle complementary products; discontinue persistently low-velocity SKUs.
- Retention: launch lifecycle emails and win-back offers; measure repeat rate and churn by cohort.
- Channel strategy: shift spend to top-converting channels; pause low-ROI campaigns.
- Forecasting & inventory: use recent trend/seasonality to set reorder points and safety stock.

#### KPIs to track
- Total revenue, gross margin, average order value (AOV)
- Repeat purchase rate, customer lifetime value (LTV)
- Conversion rate by channel/region, return rate
